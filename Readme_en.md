## Content and structure of the research project

The infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has emerged since 2019, led to public health and societal challenges. In order to be able to take appropriate measures to contain the pandemic and to gain new insights into the pandemic, there is an increased need for research on COVID-19. One starting point for this is using blood samples obtained from both infected and uninfected individuals, which are tested for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They provide information on the proportion of the population that has already been infected with SARS-CoV-2, including unrecognized infections (under-reporting).

The project "Observatory of serological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Germany" (SERO-OBS Corona) provides an overview of antibody studies (so-called seroepidemiological studies) in Germany. The seroepidemiological studies are based on blood samples from citizens tested for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus at different times during the pandemic. This will answer questions such as: What is the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different populations? What is the under-reporting factor, which shows how many times more infections have occurred compared to the previously known (reported) cases? In the present project, seroepidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 conducted in Germany since spring 2020 are continuously identified via systematic searches in study registries, literature databases including previous publications as well as media reports, and study information as well as overviews of results are made available.

The results of the SERO-OBS-Corona project are available and regularly updated on the website www.rki.de/covid-19-ak-studien, in German, and the website www.rki.de/covid-19-serostudies-germany, in English.

### Administrative and organizational details

In the project "Observatory of serological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Germany" (SERO-OBS Corona), different Units of the [Department 2 | Epidemiology and Health Monitoring](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Abt2/abt2_node) and [Department 3 | Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Abt3/abt3_node.html) of the Robert Koch Institute are involved. We thank the SeroTracker ([serotracker.com](serotracker.com)) team at the University of Calgary for helpful discussions and contributions to the operationalization of the study database and for initial programming of the interactive graphics.
Questions regarding the content of the data extraction can be addressed directly to the SERO-OBS-Corona project team at [COVID19_AK@rki.de](mailto:COVID19_AK@rki.de). The publication of the data as well as the quality management of the (meta-)data is done by the department [MF 4 | Research Data and Infromation Management](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/MFI/MF4/mf4_node.html). Questions regarding data management and the publication infrastructure can be directed to the Open Data Team of the Department MF4 at [OpenData@rki.de](mailto:OpenData@rki.de).

The project "Observatory of serological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Germany" (SERO-OBS Corona) is funded by the German Ministry of Health.

## Content and structure of the research project

Seroepidemiologic studies have been of high interest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. They provide information on the proportion of the population that has already been infected with SARS-CoV-2, including unrecognized infections (under-reporting).  
These studies have been continuously identified since spring 2020 via systematic searches in study registers, literature databases, preprints and media reports. The RKI's overarching search strategy for the novel coronavirus has been published in the journal GMS of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Medizinisches Bibliothekswesen (Erling J, Heldt K, Sturm J, 2021).

> Erling J, Heldt K, Sturm J. Lessons learned from the pandemic – ein Praxisbericht aus der Bibliothek des Robert Koch-Instituts. GMS Med Bibl Inf. 2021;21(1-2):Doc05. [DOI: 10.3205/mbi000494](https://doi.org/10.3205/mbi000494)

The studies are critically assessed, and aggregated data from already available studies from Germany are extracted and processed for analyses, for an interactive map, for a dashboard and for the regular update of a factsheet on the results of seroepidemiological SARS-CoV-2 studies in the general population in Germany. Furthermore, we carry out searches and analyses on under-reporting and infection fatality rates. The results are provided in German on the website www.rki.de/covid-19-ak-studien and in English on the website www.rki.de/covid-19-serostudies-germany. They are regularly updated.

The project SERO-OBS Corona thus provides an overview of seroepidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 conducted in Germany. The following publications resulted from the project:

### Selection and description of the object of study

Information and results of epidemiological studies on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in random samples of the general population, in blood donors and in specific population subgroups in Germany have been systematically searched for and key data are provided.


### Methods, instruments and course of data collection

Search and search strategy: (We searched for...) Seroepidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 in Germany that can be found as peer-reviewed publication in literature databases (PubMed and Embase). We also searched for manuscripts published on preprint servers prior to peer review (medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, ChemRxiv, preprints.org, ResearchSquare, Social Science Research Network (SSRN)).

After an initial search for SARS-CoV-2 and related terms, the defined search terms in the titles of the publications are “sero OR antibod OR immune OR immunity OR immunology OR fatality rate OR population-based OR cohort study OR dried blood OR test strategy”.

We also browsed reports and notifications from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and trial registries (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, ClinicalTrials.gov) and followed media coverage as well
